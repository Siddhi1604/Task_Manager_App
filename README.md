## Features

*   **Task Management:** Create, edit, delete, and view tasks.
*   **Scheduling:** Set due dates and times for tasks.
*   **Prioritization:** Assign priority levels (Low, Medium, High) with visual indicators.
*   **Status Tracking:** Mark tasks as Pending, In Progress, or Completed.
*   **Subtasks:** Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
*   **Tags:** Organize tasks using custom tags.
*   **Filtering & Sorting:** Filter tasks by status, priority, tags, or completion. Search for specific tasks.
*   **Recurring Tasks:** Set up tasks that repeat daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly (Basic pattern support).
*   **Reminders:** 
    *   Time-based reminders before the due date.
    *   Location-based reminders (trigger when entering/leaving a specified area - Requires location permissions).
*   **Calendar View:** Visualize tasks on a monthly calendar.
*   **Statistics:** View basic task completion statistics.
*   **Cross-Platform:** 
    *   Runs on Android, iOS (with native features like SQLite).
    *   Runs on Web (using SharedPreferences for storage).
*   **Theme Support:** Light and Dark mode with Material 3 design.
*   **Voice Input:** Create tasks using voice commands (experimental).

## Architecture

*   **State Management:** Provider
*   **Database (Mobile):** `sqflite` (SQLite)
*   **Storage (Web):** `shared_preferences`
*   **UI:** Flutter Widgets, `flex_color_scheme` for theming.
*   **Notifications:** `flutter_local_notifications`
*   **Location:** `geolocator`, `geocoding`
*   **Services:** Separate services for Notifications, Location, and potentially Voice Input.
*   **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) approach (loosely):**
    *   **Models:** (`lib/models/`) Define data structures (e.g., `Task`).
    *   **Views:** (`lib/screens/`, `lib/widgets/`) UI components.
    *   **ViewModels/Providers:** (`lib/providers/`) Manage state and business logic (e.g., `TaskProvider`, `ThemeProvider`).
    *   **Services:** (`lib/services/`) Handle external interactions (Notifications, Location, Database interaction via `DatabaseHelper`).

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

*   Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   Git: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   An IDE (like VS Code or Android Studio) with Flutter plugins.

**Setup & Run:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd task_manager_app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  **Configure API Keys (If Applicable):**
    *   If you are using location services that require API keys (like Google Maps Platform for web geocoding), you might need to configure them. Follow the instructions for the specific plugins (`geolocator`, `geocoding`) or services you integrate.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** Do *not* commit your API keys directly into the repository. Use environment variables, a secrets file (added to `.gitignore`), or Flutter's `--dart-define` feature.

4.  **Run the app:**
    *   Select a target device (emulator, physical device, or Chrome for web).
    *   Run the app:
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```
    *   To run specifically on Chrome:
        ```bash
        flutter run -d chrome
        ```
